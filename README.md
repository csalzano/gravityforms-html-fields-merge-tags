# Gravity Forms Merge Tags in HTML Fields

> ⚠️  **Warning**
> Do not use. I merged this feature into [Power Boost for Gravity Forms](https://wordpress.org/plugins/power-boost-for-gravity-forms/), a plugin I maintain on wordpress.org. Use Power Boost instead, and you'll get updates.

This is a WordPress plugin. It's an add-on for Gravity Forms to enable [Merge Tags](https://docs.gravityforms.com/category/user-guides/merge-tags-getting-started/) in HTML fields.

This plugin adds no menus or settings to the WordPress Dashboard. Its functionality is controlled solely by Activating and Deactivating the plugin itself.
